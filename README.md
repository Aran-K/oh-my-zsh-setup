# A (possibly) ever growing custimization of my oh-my-zsh config

To get oh-my-zsh to pick up this config, modify the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` variable in your `.zshrc` to point to this directory
To load custom plugins run `load_custom_plugins.sh` and restart your terminal

At least install these dependencies (Ubuntu):
`apt install fonts-powerline`
`apt install screenfetch`
